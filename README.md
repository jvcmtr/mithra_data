# Mithra Data
Mithra data exposed data related to my TTRPG system. 

> THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS !

## About
This Python project serves as a kind of static repository for my other project, [Mithra Web-App](https://github.com/jvcmtr/mithra_webapp). It processes files from `_raw_files` and outputs a `Data.json` that gets exposed via github-pages so that the WebApp can use it.

## Running
To execute the program simply run:
``` powershell
python run main
```
or for testing purposes
```
python run test
```
To configure it access `_config.py` at the root of the repository.

## Documentation
I am documenting the development process on the [docs folder](https://github.com/jvcmtr/mithra_data/tree/master/docs). Nothing fancy. just some planning, brainstorming and resources. The documentation is mostly in brazilian portuguese but with a little english. I try to avoid it, but since the TTRPG is written in portuguese and i usually program in english, this mess is bound to happend.
